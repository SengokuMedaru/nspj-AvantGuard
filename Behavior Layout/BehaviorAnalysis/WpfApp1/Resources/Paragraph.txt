This is a simple paragraph that is meant to be nice and easy to type so i guess this means that it cannot really be considered a paragraph but just a series of run on sentences this should help us gauge your usual typing speed and techniques. I think that i will not just tell you a story about the time i went to the zoo and found a monkey and a fox playing together. They were so cute and i think that they were not supposed to be in the same cage but they somehow were. And i loved watching them horse around forgive the pun well i hope that it has been highly enjoyable typing this paragraph and i wish you have a great experience using our application!
